## Problem 17

Split an array into an array with two subarrays. Make the length of the first array equal to the second argument. The second array should contain the rest of the items in the original array.

## Example

`ninetynine:split([1,2,3,4,5], 2)` should return `[[1,2], [3,4,5]]`

## Code

Save the `problem-17.xqm` and `test-17.xqm` in the same folder and use the command bar: `TEST test-17.xqm` to check your code.
